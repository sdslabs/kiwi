## Overview

You can think of Kiwi as thread safe global variables. This kind of library
comes in helpful when you need to manage state accross your application which
can be mutated with multiple threads. Kiwi protects your keys with mutex locks
so you don't have to.

Head over to [kiwi.sdslabs.co](https://kiwi.sdslabs.co) for more details and
documentation.

## Installation

> Kiwi requires [Go](https://golang.org/) >= 1.14

Kiwi can be integrated with your application just like any other go library.

```sh
go get -u github.com/sdslabs/kiwi
```

Now you can import kiwi any where in your code.

```go
import "github.com/sdslabs/kiwi"
```

## Basic usage

Create a store, add key and play with it. It's that easy!

```go
store := stdkiwi.NewStore()

if err := store.AddKey("my_string", "str"); err != nil {
  // handle error
}

myString := store.Str("my_string")

if err := myString.Update("Hello, World!"); err != nil {
  // handle error
}

str, err := myString.Get()
if err != nil {
  // handle error
}

fmt.Println(str) // Hello, World!
```
